Backup and recovery is good because of the cloud storage
Global availability, because it is on the cloud
Cons

Cost considerations
Vendor demands may cause you to have to work under their guideline in order to use there storage.

For my project I have decided to go with theuser defaults mainly because I am currently only dealing with a small amount of data that doesnâ€™t have to be extremely secure. It being able to use just a key value storage system works very well for this case.
