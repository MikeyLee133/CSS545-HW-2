SQLite Database
Pros and Cons

Pros:
Full control of the database schema, allows the developer and team to define custom database schema and create queries for specific use cases for their project/assignment.
SQLite is lightweight and optimized for performance and reliability
Good for complex data models
Widely used by many in the industry 
Cons:
Developers/team is responsible for managing the database connections, transactions, and memory usage that can have errors
Raw SQL for data manipulation and revival 
Security propers from improper handling of improperly handled SQL queries could expose data that was not intended.


User Defaults
Pros:
Lightweight and easy to use, provides a simple key-value interface for storing a small amount of user preferences/configuration data
Automatic serializaon 
Integration with the settings app, thus the user can look at their settings and make changes to them
Cons:
Limited data size
Lack of encryption
Not as secured 
No querying or indexing

Cloud Storage
Pros
Scalability and flexibility are probably the greatest among the options here
Backup and recovery are good because of the cloud storage
Global availability, because it is on the cloud
Cons
Needs network connectivity to work
Cost considerations
Vendor demands may cause you to have to work under their guideline in order to use their storage.

For my project, I have decided to go with the user defaults mainly because I am currently only dealing with a small amount of data that doesnâ€™t have to be extremely secure.
It being able to use just a key-value storage system works very well for this case.
